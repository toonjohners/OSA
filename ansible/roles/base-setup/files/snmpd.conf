# SECTION: Access Control Setup
#
#   This section defines who is allowed to talk to your running
#   snmp agent.

# rwuser: a SNMPv3 read-write user
#   arguments:  user [noauth|auth|priv] [restriction_oid]
rwuser    
# rouser: a SNMPv3 read-only user
#   arguments:  user [noauth|auth|priv] [restriction_oid]

rouser    

# rocommunity: a SNMPv1/SNMPv2c read-only access community name
#   arguments:  community [default|hostname|network/bits] [oid]

rocommunity public default .1
# rwcommunity: a SNMPv1/SNMPv2c read-write access community name
#   arguments:  community [default|hostname|network/bits] [oid]

# SECTION: System Information Setup
#
#   This section defines some of the information reported in
#   the "system" mib group in the mibII tree.

# syslocation: The [typically physical] location of the system.
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysLocation.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  location_string

syslocation Unknown (edit /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf)

# syscontact: The contact information for the administrator
#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysContact.0 variable will make
#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
#   the variable.
#   arguments:  contact_string

syscontact Root <root@localhost> (configure /etc/snmp/snmp.local.conf)

# SECTION: Extending the Agent
#
#   You can extend the snmp agent to have it return information
#   that you yourself define.

extend mailqstats /root/mailqstats.sh
extend test /root/test.sh

# pass: Run a command that intepretes the request for an entire tree.
#   The pass program defined here will get called for all
#   requests below a certain point in the mib tree.  It is then
#   responsible for returning the right data beyond that point.
#   
#   arguments: miboid program
#   
#   example: pass .1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.255 /path/to/local/passtest
#   
#   See the snmpd.conf manual page for further information.
#   
#   Consider using "pass_persist" for a performance increase.

pass .1.3.6.1.4.1.4413.4.1 /usr/bin/ucd5820stat

# SECTION: Trap Destinations
#
#   Here we define who the agent will send traps to.

# trapsink: A SNMPv1 trap receiver
#   arguments: host [community] [portnum]

trapsink    

# trap2sink: A SNMPv2c trap receiver
#   arguments: host [community] [portnum]

trap2sink    

# informsink: A SNMPv2c inform (acknowledged trap) receiver
#   arguments: host [community] [portnum]

informsink    

# trapcommunity: Default trap sink community to use
#   arguments: community-string

trapcommunity  

# authtrapenable: Should we send traps when authentication failures occur
#   arguments: 1 | 2   (1 = yes, 2 = no)

authtrapenable  1

# SECTION: Monitor Various Aspects of the Running Host
#
#   The following check up on various aspects of a host.

# proc: Check for processes that should be running.
#     proc NAME [MAX=0] [MIN=0]
#   
#     NAME:  the name of the process to check for.  It must match
#            exactly (ie, http will not find httpd processes).
#     MAX:   the maximum number allowed to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#     MIN:   the minimum number to be running.  Defaults to 0.
#   
#   The results are reported in the prTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree
#   Special Case:  When the min and max numbers are both 0, it assumes
#   you want a max of infinity and a min of 1.

proc    

# disk: Check for disk space usage of a partition.
#   The agent can check the amount of available disk space, and make
#   sure it is above a set limit.  
#   
#    disk PATH [MIN=100000]
#   
#    PATH:  mount path to the disk in question.
#    MIN:   Disks with space below this value will have the Mib's errorFlag set.
#           Can be a raw byte value or a percentage followed by the %
#           symbol.  Default value = 100000.
#   
#   The results are reported in the dskTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree

#   
#    load [1MAX=12.0] [5MAX=12.0] [15MAX=12.0]
#   
#    1MAX:   If the 1 minute load average is above this limit at query
#            time, the errorFlag will be set.
#    5MAX:   Similar, but for 5 min average.
#    15MAX:  Similar, but for 15 min average.
#   
#   The results are reported in the laTable section of the UCD-SNMP-MIB tree

# file: Check on the size of a file.
#   Display a files size statistics.
#   If it grows to be too large, report an error about it.

#    file /path/to/file [maxsize_in_bytes]

#      if maxsize is not specified, assume only size reporting is needed.
